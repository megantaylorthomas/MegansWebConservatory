						<h1>About The Project</h1>
						<p> Since my fascination for botany began I have wanted to combine that passion with my
							technical
							skills. My web conservatory was my first foot in the door. This project serves several
							purposes. As
							my house plant collection has grown I have found a need to showcase, catalog, and manage my
							houseplants. After hours of research into botany in conjunction with my personal experience,
							I have
							created a profile for each of my house plants. Every profile contains key care information
							such as
							watering, light, and humidity. The profiles also share interesting information on toxicity,
							expected
							growth, and the plant's origins. While the website acts as an online catalog it also doubles
							as a
							plant identification system. Each of my house plants has an identification tag containing a
							QR code.
							When friends or family have questions about a house plant or possibly want one themself,
							they simply
							scan the tag, and the plant profile is presented.

						The technical architecture behind the sites implements a CI/CD pipeline from my GitHub repo to
						an S3
						bucket. The architecture behind the website is rather simple, as showcased in the diagram below.
						The
						simplistic architecture is by design as it allows for straightforward support and modifications.
						The
						code behind the project is a blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although this website is
						currently
						static, behind the scenes it is getting a makeover. I am in the process of adding each plant
						profile
						to a DynamoDB instance. I have created a lambda function to query the DB which can be called
						through
						an API gateway. Once I have added all plant profiles to the DynamoDB instance I will rewrite the
						code to pull from the API on page load. While the cloud architecture, website, and QR are
						nothing
						groundbreaking in terms of computing, what I would like to focus on is the application of the
						technology. Having the option to pull up a plant profile with a click of a button makes
						accessing
						information simple and easy. This is what I find as the most important part of the project.
						Technology is only as powerful as how you choose to use it. Using technology to help others
						learn is
						where my passions truly lie!</p>
