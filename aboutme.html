				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Welcome! My name is Megan Thomas. I am a software engineer with professional experience in cloud
					computing, web applications development, computer architecture, and automation. Explore and get to
					know me outside of my professional work. </p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/me.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>I love plants. No matter what room you enter in my home, there are always a few house plants there to
					greet you, if that was not obvious already. Plant care is a special skill - many people claim to not
					have a green thumb. I will admit it takes some patience, willingness to learn, critical analysis,
					and thorough planning for your plants to thrive. However, it is not as difficult as many cares to
					believe.</p>
				<p>I have the same mindset when it comes to architecting computer systems and developing software. The
					more time you spend growing your systems, nurturing your skills and planning thoroughly the more
					your systems will thrive. And in turn, your admiration for technology may just bloom as well. (Sorry
					for so many plant double entendres - I couldn't help myself.)</p>
				<p>Most recently, I put that mindset to work as an Enterprise Tools and Automation Engineer for 3M
					Technology Transformation Services. My main responsibilities included designing, developing, and
					deploying a variety of enterprise-scale applications and automation on-premise and in the AWS Cloud.
					The languages I primarily used were PowerShell, SQL, VB.Net, and Python but as with many IT
					positions we were expected to teach ourselves new languages and services on a whim. The most
					valuable thing I gained from this position is learning how to learn in a fast-paced environment.</p>
				<p>I would love to combine my passion for plants with my technical abilities in a professional capacity
					and am currently looking for a new full-time position. If youâ€™re interested in grabbing coffee and
					talking shop (or sharing some plant tips), feel free to reach out. Thanks!</p>
